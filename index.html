        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I have a lifelong passion for science and the natural world.
            I am a curious person who enjoys learning new things, investigating scientific problems,
            and synthesizing my findings into words and images. As a scientist at heart, I find great satisfaction
            in the creative process of coding, where every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new.
            Over the course of my professional career, I have worked in academia, public educational institutions,
            pharmaceutical companies, and software houses.
            I am fluent in Polish (my native language), English and Spanish.
            In the following sections, you can find a more detailed description of my professional experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always open to new challenges and interesting projects.

            <p>
                During my research career, I developed a set of programming skills, which initially served me
                mostly as a tool for analysis of output data from quantum-mechanical calculations. As I gained more
                experience, I became increasingly interested in coding itself, and for the last couple of years,
                I have been working full-time as a software engineer.
                I am currently employed as a Python developer at
                <a href="https://www.bmat.com/" target="_blank">BMAT Music Innovators</a>,
                where I am part of a team responsible for an application managing the distribution of royalties.
                My other experience in this field includes: data analysis and development of machine learning
                models at a bioinformatics startup, contributing to computer science research
                (check out

            <img src="icons/periodic-table.png" alt="" class="skill-image left">
            <p>I was involved with chemistry as a subject of study and research for 15 years.
                In 2018 I obtained a <span class="bold">PhD degree in chemical sciences</span> at
                University of Warsaw. My research was focused on compounds of silver and their potential
                application as novel high-temperature superconductors. As part of Prof. Wojciech Grochala's
                team at University of Warsaw's Center of New Technologies, I approached this topic from a variety of
                angles, including photoelectron spectroscopy, high-pressure crystallography, and—in recent
                years—computational modelling of new hypothetical silver- and hydride-based materials.
                As of <span id="dateA"></span>,
                I have written or contributed to <span class="bold">19 scientific papers</span>,
                a complete list of which can be found on

            <h2>Science communication</h2>
            <img src="icons/science.png" alt="" class="skill-image right">
            <p>Throughout my professional life, I have had many opportunities to discuss science with diverse groups of
                people and using different means of communication. I worked as an explainer at Copernicus Science Center
                in Warsaw, where I would engage in conversations with visitors of all ages in order to enhance their
                experience and explain scientific topics to them in an accessible manner. I have written many scientific
                articles for specialized journals and delivered talks at international conferences.
                As part of my PhD studies, I taught and assisted undergraduate students in laboratory classes.
                At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked at Pfizer, where I participated in the vaccine rollout
                in the European Union as a medical information consultant.<br>
